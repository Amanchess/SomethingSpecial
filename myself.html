                <p>Dear Lizu,</p>
                <p>I have something important to tell you, and I couldn't think of a better way to express it than through this webpage. I've known you for a while now, and I can't stop thinking about you. I admire your intelligence, your kindness, and your beautiful smile. You make my heart skip a beat every time I see you.</p>
                <p>I know that we're good friends, but I can't help but feel that there could be something more between us. I want to be with you and take care of you. I want to make you happy and see you smile every day. I want to create beautiful memories with you and share our lives together.</p>
                <p>So, Lizu, I ask you: will you be mine? Will you give me the honor of being your partner, your confidant, and your love?</p>
                <button>Yes, I Will Be Yours!</button>
